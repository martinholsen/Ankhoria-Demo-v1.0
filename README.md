## Weapons

    Runic Revolver - Removes 10% of targets max mana on hit. The amount of mana is also dealt as damage to the target. 
    
    Stunning Crossbow - Fires a projectile that stuns and deals damage (nonballistic). The stun increases with distance. 
    
    Handcannon - Launches a slow but powerful projectile that explodes on impact with ground or target. The damage increases 
    with time. 
    
    Manadrinker - This sword deals damage to mana instead and steals a portion of it.
    
    Solar Staff - Charges up a powerful beam of solar power. Player is slow while charging. (hitscan)
    
    Darkbomb - Lobs a bomb that explodes on impact with a target or after a set time. If the bomb is hit with one of your projectiles, 
    it explodes instantly for double damage and radius. 
    
    Minmore Musket - Fires a round that deals moderate damage. Successful hits reduces the cooldown, and increases damage permanently 
    (until the end of the match).
    
    Blackfire Lantern - Consumes mana when used. Fires a ball of fire. Deals 30% of targets current health. All DoT-effects on target 
    are consumed and the equivalent damage is dealt instantly. 
    
    Rapier - Deals double dmg on full mana, drains mana slowly, can parry attacks to block all dmg and regain mana (timing and precision
    requred for parry)
    
## Passive Abilities

    Manashield - A portion of the damage taken is transfered to mana damage instead
    
    Speed Charger - Charging a weapon takes less time
    
## Active Abilities

    Life Tap - Convert a portion of your health to mana
    
    Void Prison - Create an area of inescapable void
    
    Decay - Creates an orb mid air. After a short while, it explodes applying a DoT. If the target already has Decay, it will stack 
    and refresh its full duration

## Concepts

    Melee charge attack - Charging a melee attack will make give your attack certain attributes like extra movement or dmg (movement:
    think doomfist, dmg: Think super smash chargeattacks)
