    Stunning Crossbow - Fires a projectile that stuns and deals damage (nonballistic). The stun increases with distance. 
    
    Handcannon - Launches a slow but powerful projectile that explodes on impact with ground or target. The damage increases 
    with time.

    Solar Staff - Charges up a powerful beam of solar power. Player is slow while charging. (hitscan)

    it explodes instantly for double damage and radius. 
    
    Minmore Musket - Fires a round that deals moderate damage. Successful hits reduces the cooldown, and increases damage permanently 
    (until the end of the match).
    
    Blackfire Lantern - Consumes mana when used. Fires a ball of fire. Deals 30% of targets current health. All DoT-effects on target 
    are consumed and the equivalent damage is dealt instantly. 
    
    Rapier - Deals double dmg on full mana, drains mana slowly, can parry attacks to block all dmg and regain mana (timing and precision
    requred for parry)
